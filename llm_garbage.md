In the blorp of the net, where pixels do prance,
the web server flibbles and flobbles in dance.

With a sizzle and pop, Tomcat burbles and dives,
Java gloop in a cauldron, where sanity strives.

Cassandra's a wibblety, slorpish delight,
It wriggles and jiggles in the murky night.

In clumps of confusion, Hadoop thwacks and it wheezes,
A flibberty-gibbet, where logic just freezes.

# 88 Lines about 44 Projects

This started out as an idea I had many years ago for trying to become more
familiar with the steadily-increasing number of projects comprising the
[Apache Software Foundation](https://apache.org/).

My experience is that many project communities and clusters of project
communities (e.g. Hadoop, Cassandra, Machine-Learning, etc.) are very
insular and don't know much about projects, volunteers, etc. who are
involved in projects disjointed from their own.

This was a silly way to remind attendees of the
[Community over Code Conference](https://communityovercode.org/) (n√©e ApacheCon)
that there are probably many many projects they don't know about
and to encourage them to learn about them.

After some encouragement, I presented the [initial (technically incomplete)
version](original.md) of this work as a Lightning Talk at CoC North America in
Halifax, NS, Canada on 10 October 2023. I reprised the performance at
CoC Europe in Bratislava, Slovakia on 5 June 2024.

For CoC North America in Denver, CO, USA, I finally:

1. Completed the song (88 proper lines!)
1. Converted from plaintxt to markdown (including adding links, etc.)
1. Published on GitHub

Please understand that this song is not intended to be super accurate
when it comes to project descriptions. It was more intended to capture
a hint of each project and apply some intentionally tortured rhyming.

I hope you enjoy it.
